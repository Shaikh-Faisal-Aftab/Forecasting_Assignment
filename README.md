# Forecasting_Assignment

Forecasting involves predicting what can happen in the future by considering past and present events and incidents. Forecasting is a decision-making tool that helps businesses cope with the uncertainty surrounding a business by carefully examining historical data and trends.

It can also be labelled as a planning tool allowing businesses to plot their upcoming moves and budgets accordingly. Companies use the forecasting tool with the hope that it will cover all the uncertainties that might occur. It is generally considered a good practice to indicate the degree of uncertainty attached to forecasts. One thing should always be kept in mind; the data must be up to date to forecast accurately.

It is essential for short-range and long-range planning. For example, the evening news gives the weather "forecast," not the weather "prediction." anyway, the terms forecast and prediction are often used interchangeably. Forecasting is based on many assumptions, such as:

The past will repeat itself. It means that what has happened in the past will happen again.
As the forecast horizon shortens, forecast accuracy increases. For example, a forecast for tomorrow will be more accurate than a forecast for next month, and a forecast for next year will be more accurate than a forecast for next year.
Forecasting in the aggregate is more accurate than forecasting individual items. This means that a company can forecast total demand over its entire spectrum of products more accurately than it can forecast individual stock-keeping units (SKUs). For example, General Motors can more accurately forecast the total number of cars needed for next year than the total number of white Chevrolet Impalas with a certain option package.
Forecasts are seldom accurate. Furthermore, forecasts are rarely accurate. While some are very close, few are "right on the money." Therefore, it is wise to offer a forecast "range." If one were to forecast demand of 100,000 units for the next month, it is extremely unlikely that demand would equal 100,000 exactly. However, a forecast of 90,000 to 110,000 would provide a much larger target for planning.
